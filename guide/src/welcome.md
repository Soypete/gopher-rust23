# Introduction to Rust - for Gophers

## Welcome to GopherCon 2023!

Today's talk is taken from our [Ultimate Rust Foundations](https://github.com/thebracket/ArdanUltimateRust-5Days/tree/main) class.

We've got 4 hours, and we're going to try and fit in a complete "get your hands dirty with Rust" guide.

## Who Am I?

I'm Herbert Wolverson, Rust Lead with [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/). I'm also the author of *Hands-on Rust* and *Rust Brain Teasers* with Pragmatic Programmers.

> You can get 30% off of any ebook from [pragprog.com](https://pragprog.com/) with the code `RUSTCONF23`. Expires October 15th.

## Format for Today

4 Hours is a long time to sit still! We'll take a short break around the end of each hour, so you can stretch your legs and get some water. If you get *really* stuck, I'll try and help you during the break. Otherwise, Bill is here to help you out--just raise your hand and he'll come over.

> Please add your name and email address to the sign-in sheet being passed around. We'll use it to send you a link to the slides and code after the talk, and enter you into a raffle for a free copy of *Hands-on Rust* or *Rust-Brain Teasers*.
