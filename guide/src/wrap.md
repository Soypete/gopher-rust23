# Wrap Up

We've covered a lot in the four hours we've been here!

* You started by creating "Hello, world" in Rust.
* You learned about Cargo, Rust's package manager.
* You've packaged up multiple projects into a workspace, to save compile time and disk space.
* You've learned about variables, mutability, and shadowing.
* You've learned about scope, return, and the unit type.
* You've learned about scopes and functions.
* You've learned about move by default, and how to clone data, borrow data and work with the borrow checker.
* You've learned how to group data together in structs.
* You've learned how the `Drop` trait saves you from having to clean up by hand, even though you don't have a garbage collector.
* You've learned to use `Rc` and `Arc` to pretend that you do have a garbage collector, for those times that ownership is unclear.
* You've learned about enumerations: both simple, and enumerations that contain data.
* You've learned about pattern matching ang the `match` statement.
* You've learned to store data in array, vector and HashMap collections - and iterate the data.
* You've learned to serialize data to JSON - and other formats - and back.
* You've learned about asynchronous Rust, and how to use the `async` and `await` keywords.
* You've learned about futures, and how to use them - and how to work with threads when you need to mix and match high CPU throughput with high I/O throughput.
* You've learned how to create a web service using Axum.
* You've learned how to create a REST client with Reqwest.
* You've learned to use SQLX to interact with a database.
* You've used SQLX as a layer in Axum, to create a REST service that uses a database.
* You've used database migrations to help automate deployment.

In other words---four hours is enough to get you building real-world Rust applications, with great performance.
